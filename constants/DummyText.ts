export const DND_LOREM = `In the murky depths of the Enshadowed Marsh, a Grung named Kribbleg grew up in solitude, mastering the ways of the swamp and the ancient art of druidic magic.
From an early age, he found solace and comfort in the dark, damp environment, developing a unique bond with the swamp's flora and fauna.
Guided by his innate connection to nature, Kribbleg became a skilled fisherman, providing sustenance for himself and occasionally trading the abundant catch with neighboring villages for other supplies.
However, Kribbleg's past held dark secrets that haunted his every step. Long ago, an enigmatic cult had infiltrated his peaceful swamp home, seeking to tap into the mystical energy of the marsh.
The cult's dark rituals corrupted the swamp's ecosystem, causing suffering to its inhabitants and leaving a trail of devastation in their wake. Kribbleg witnessed the horrors firsthand, as the once-vibrant swamp turned into a twisted reflection of its former self.
As the lone survivor of the cult's malevolent schemes, Kribbleg felt both survivor's guilt and a sense of responsibility to protect the swamp he loved.
Determined to restore the balance and heal the swamp's wounds, he took up the mantle of a druid and devoted his life to preserving the fragile ecosystem and its inhabitants.
With a staff carved from a sacred tree that stood as a testament to his connection to the swamp's heart, Kribbleg ventured beyond the marsh's boundaries.
He sought allies to help him cleanse the taint left by the cult and prevent its malevolence from spreading further.
Along his journey, he encountered a diverse group of adventurers who shared his goal of purging darkness and restoring harmony to the land.`
